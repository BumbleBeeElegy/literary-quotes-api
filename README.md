# Literary Quotes API

> [!NOTE]
> This repository contains documentation for a mock API that was created as part of an API documentation course. The API is imaginary, but all testing scenarios and examples are real.

The Literary Quotes REST API makes it easy to integrate a curated database of literary quotes into your applications.

## Documentation

To get started with the API, see the [Literary Quotes API documentation](https://bumblebeeelegy.github.io/literary-quotes-api/docs/index).
