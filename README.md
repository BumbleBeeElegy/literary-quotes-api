# Literary Quotes API

> [!NOTE]
> This repository contains documentation for a mock API that was created as part of an API documentation course. The API is imaginary, but the API specifications, documentation, and examples are real and can be tested.

The Literary Quotes REST API makes it easy to integrate a curated database of literary quotes into your applications.

## Documentation
