# Prerequisites

Before you start using the Literary Quotes API, make sure you have:

- **A basic understanding of RESTful APIs.** Familiarity with RESTful API concepts, including:

  -  Resources
  -  Endpoints
  -  HTTP request methods
  -  Query parameters
  -  Response formats (JSON).

  If you're new to APIs, we recommend going through some [Rest API tutorials](https://restapitutorial.com/) first. The [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) is also a handy reference to define some of the terms and concepts used here.

- **An HTTP client.** A tool to make HTTP requests to the API. Popular options include:
  - [cURL](https://curl.se/): A command-line tool for making HTTP requests. It's pre-installed on most Unix-based systems (macOS and Linux) and on Windows 10 version 1803 and later.
  - [Postman](https://www.postman.com/): A graphical user interface (GUI) tool for making HTTP requests. It provides a user-friendly interface to construct and send requests, view responses, and organize API requests into collections.

- **Access to the Literary Quotes API.** You'll need:
  - The base URL where the API is hosted (`http://localhost:3000`)
  - Base64-encoded authentication credentials (username and password) to access the API.

  To be successful, we'd recommend going through the tutorial to [set up a local testing environment](placeholder-link).
