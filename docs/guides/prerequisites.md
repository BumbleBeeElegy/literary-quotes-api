# Prerequisites

Before you start using the Literary Quotes API, you'll need:

- **A basic understanding of RESTful APIs.** Familiarity with following RESTful API concepts is recommended:

  -  Resources and endpoints
  -  HTTP request methods and response codes
  -  Query parameters
  -  Response formats (JSON).

  If you're new to APIs, we recommend starting with some [REST API tutorials](https://restapitutorial.com/) first. You can also find a lot of other tutorials and information online to learn more about REST APIs, including resources like the [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) and the [REST Guidelines](https://www.belgif.be/specification/rest/api-guide/) from the Belgian Interoperability Framework.

- **An HTTP client.** A tool to make HTTP requests to the API. Popular options include:
  - [cURL](https://curl.se/): A command-line tool for making HTTP requests. It's pre-installed on most Unix-based systems (macOS and Linux) and on Windows 10 version 1803 and later.
  - [Postman](https://www.postman.com/): A graphical user interface (GUI) tool for making HTTP requests. It provides a user-friendly interface to construct and send requests, view responses, and organize API requests into collections.

- **Access to the Literary Quotes API.** You'll need:
  - Access to the [GitHub repository for the API](https://github.com/BumbleBeeElegy/literary-quotes-api)
  - The json-server running on`http://localhost:3000`
  - Base64-encoded authentication credentials (username:password) to test authorization.

  To get started with the API, [set up a local testing environment](./set-up-testing-environment.md), then follow along with the examples in the documentation.
