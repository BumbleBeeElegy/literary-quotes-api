title: Introduction to the Literary Quotes API
type: overview
---
> [!NOTE]
> This repository contains documentation for a mock API that was created as part of an API documentation course. The API is imaginary, but all testing scenarios and examples are real.

The Literary Quotes REST API makes it easy to integrate a curated database of literary quotes into your applications.

The database contains hand-selected quotes from a variety of high-quality sources, from both fiction and nonfiction categories, and including a wide array of literary genres.

All material is public domain in the United States and has been sourced from  Project Gutenberg. If you're not in the United States, please contact Support to find out about possible local-based content restrictions.

To get started with the API, [set up a local testing environment](placeholder).
