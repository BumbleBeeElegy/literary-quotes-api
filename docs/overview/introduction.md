# Introduction to the Literary Quotes API

> [!NOTE]
> This repository contains documentation for a mock API that was created as part of an API documentation course. The API and email addresses are imaginary, but the examples in the documentation can be tested.

The Literary Quotes REST API makes it easy to integrate a curated database of literary quotes into your applications.

The database contains hand-selected quotes from a variety of high-quality works. Quotes are available from both fiction and nonfiction categories, and from an array of literary genres.

All material is public domain in the United States and has been sourced from  Project Gutenberg. If you're not in the United States, please contact [Support](mailto:support+api@example.com) to learn more about possible location-based content restrictions.

To learn more about pricing, [contact the Sales team](mailto:sales+api@example.com).

To get started with the API, [set up a local testing environment](placeholder).
